Notes for 2/22 Meeting

questions:
Why does ogb not include feature vectors (have to instatiate random ones yourself)
 - it does, figure out how it works
What is the residual in GAT implementation
 - not important
What are "classes" in obg data
 - classes of labels, outputs of neural networks

Notes:
current graphSAGE understanding:
 - most gnn models work well as long as no new nodes are introduced
 - graphSage tries to improve generalizability of graph, how well it can perform when new nodes introduced
 - user inputs K: the degree to which neighbor nodes are aggregated to orignal node
    - i.e. K=2 means branch out to all two nodes from original node
 - when new node introduced, pass it through same aggregator for Kth layer with all of new nodes' connections


 Todos:
  - graphSAGE impelementation in DGL using primitives
  - try impelemeting GCN primitives in other frameworks (ie PyG, Graphiler,..)
  - understand specific methods about primitives, see how an equivalent can be implemented
